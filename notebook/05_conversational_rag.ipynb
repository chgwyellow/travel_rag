      "At 605 ft (184 m) high, the Space Needle was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River in the United States. The tower is 138 ft (42 m) wide, weighs 9,550 short tons (8,660 metric tons), and is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.0 magnitude, as strong as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake.\n",

On April 19, 1999, the city's Landmarks Preservation Board designated the tower a historic landmark.\n",

It consists of a 24-foot-high (7.3 m) by 14-foot-wide (4.3 m) steel archway as well as a plaza with seating areas. The archway is composed of oversized tools, including a try square, spirit level, and carpenter pencil. The seating area includes benches shaped into I-beams and a cog, with cast bronze replicas of workbench tools soldered onto the granite tops. Both elements honor the industrial legacy of Seattle's SoDo neighborhood by using \"tools of the trade\".\n",

    "In this chapter, we enhanced our basic RAG system with two critical features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ **Conversation Memory** (Steps 01-04)\n",
    "- ✅ Added `ChatMessageHistory` to store conversation context\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented `RunnableWithMessageHistory` to manage sessions\n",
    "- ✅ Created conversational prompts with `MessagesPlaceholder`\n",
    "- ✅ Enabled multi-turn dialogues with context awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefit:** The system can now understand follow-up questions and pronouns like \"it\", \"there\", \"that\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ **Source Citations** (Steps 05-07)\n",
    "- ✅ Modified RAG chain to return source documents\n",
    "- ✅ Used `RunnableParallel` to output both answers and sources\n",
    "- ✅ Created citation formatters for clear source display\n",
    "- ✅ Tested the complete system with memory + citations\n",
