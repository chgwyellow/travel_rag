      "\n",
      "1.  **Space Needle:** The quintessential Seattle icon. Ride the elevator to the top for breathtaking panoramic views of the city skyline, Puget Sound, Mount Rainier, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains. It's especially stunning at sunset.\n",

      "2.  **Chihuly Garden and Glass:** Located right next to the Space Needle in Seattle Center, this museum showcases the stunning glass artwork of Dale Chihuly. The vibrant colors and intricate designs, especially in the Glasshouse and the outdoor garden, are truly mesmerizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP):** Also in Seattle Center, MoPOP is a vibrant and interactive museum dedicated to contemporary pop culture.

      "    *   **Explore the diverse stalls:** fresh produce, local crafts, flowers, specialty foods.\n",
      "    *   **Visit the original Starbucks** (though often very crowded).\n",
      "    *   **See the Gum Wall** (a quirky, somewhat gross, but iconic photo op).\n",
      "    *   **Eat:** Sample delicious clam chowder, pastries, and international foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Ferry Rides:** Take a Washington State Ferry across Puget Sound for incredible views of the city skyline, surrounding islands, and mountains. A popular short trip is to Bainbridge Island, where you can walk around the charming town before returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Kerry Park:** Located in the Queen Anne neighborhood, this park offers the most iconic postcard view of the Seattle skyline, with the Space Needle, Elliott Bay, and Mount Rainier (on a clear day) perfectly framed. It's especially popular at sunrise or sunset.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Bill Speidel's Underground Tour (Pioneer Square):** Explore the subterranean passages that were once the ground-level streets and storefronts of Seattle before the city was raised after the Great Fire of 1889. It's a humorous and fascinating look into Seattle's quirky history.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Ballard Locks (Hiram M. Chittenden Locks):** Connect Puget Sound to Lake Union and Lake Washington. Watch boats navigate the locks, and during salmon season (typically July-September), visit the fish ladder to see salmon migrating upstream through underwater viewing windows. The surrounding botanical gardens are also beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "9.  **Gas Works Park:** A unique urban park on the north shore of Lake Union, built on the site of a former gasification plant. It offers fantastic views of the Seattle skyline, particularly at sunset, and features the preserved remains of the plant as an industrial sculpture.\n",

    "1. ✅ **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash\n",
    "2. ✅ **Vector Store**: Loaded ChromaDB with 62 Seattle attractions\n",
    "3. ✅ **Retriever**: Configured similarity search (k=5)\n",
    "4. ✅ **Prompt Template**: Designed effective RAG prompt\n",
    "5. ✅ **RAG Chain**: Assembled complete pipeline using LCEL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Results:**\n",
    "- ✅ Basic Q&A: Accurate answers for simple questions\n",
    "- ✅ Complex Queries: Handled multi-part questions successfully\n",
    "- ✅ Out-of-scope: Correctly refused questions outside database\n",
    "- ✅ Location Queries: Found nearby attractions effectively\n",
